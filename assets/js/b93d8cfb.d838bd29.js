Yeah, us too.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![Speed banner](./speed-banner.jpg)\\n\\n## Why We Built This\\n\\nLet\'s be honest - Express is great. Fastify is fast. But sometimes you need **absurd** performance. The kind that makes you question if your monitoring tools are broken because the numbers seem too good.\\n\\nThat\'s where uWebSockets.js comes in. It\'s written in C++ and can handle orders of magnitude more requests than traditional Node.js frameworks. And now, it plays nicely with InversifyJS.\\n\\n## What You Get\\n\\n### \u{1F680} Blazing Fast by Default\\n\\nuWebSockets.js doesn\'t just claim to be fast - it\'s benchmarked as one of the fastest HTTP servers in existence. Not just in Node.js. **In existence**. We\'re talking microsecond response times.\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { InversifyUwebSocketsHttpAdapter } from \'@inversifyjs/http-uwebsockets\';\\nimport { Container } from \'inversify\';\\n\\nconst adapter = new InversifyUwebSocketsHttpAdapter(container, {\\n  logger: true,\\n  useJson: true,\\n});\\n\\nconst app = await adapter.build();\\n\\napp.listen(\'0.0.0.0\', 3000, (socket) => {\\n  console.log(\'Server running at lightning speed \u{1F680}\');\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### \u{1F4A7} Smart Stream Handling\\n\\nFile uploads? Video streaming? Large data transfers? The adapter handles backpressure automatically, so your server won\'t choke on large payloads:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { Controller, Get } from \'@inversifyjs/http-core\';\\nimport { createReadStream } from \'node:fs\';\\n\\n@Controller({ path: \'/api\' })\\nexport class VideoController {\\n  @Get(\'/stream-video\')\\n  public streamVideo() {\\n    const stream = createReadStream(\'./video.mp4\');\\n    return stream; // That\'s it. Really.\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe adapter automatically:\\n- Pauses the stream when the client\'s buffer is full\\n- Resumes when the client is ready\\n- Cleans up on disconnections\\n- Handles errors gracefully\\n\\n### \u{1F3AF} Full Framework Support\\n\\nYou don\'t lose any InversifyJS superpowers:\\n\\n- **Guards** for authorization checks\\n- **Middleware** for request processing\\n- **Interceptors** for response transformation\\n- **Error filters** for unified error handling\\n- Full dependency injection with decorators\\n\\n```typescript\\n@Controller({ path: \'/secure\' })\\n@UseGuard(AuthGuard)\\nexport class SecureController {\\n  @Post(\'/data\')\\n  @ApplyMiddleware(RateLimitMiddleware)\\n  public async handleData(@Body() data: DataDto) {\\n    // Your business logic here\\n    return { success: true };\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## When Should You Use It?\\n\\n### \u2705 Perfect For:\\n\\n- **High-throughput APIs** - Handling thousands of requests per second\\n- **Real-time applications** - WebSockets support built-in\\n- **Streaming services** - Video, audio, or large file transfers\\n- **Microservices** - Where every millisecond counts\\n- **IoT backends** - Managing thousands of device connections\\n\\n### \u{1F914} Maybe Not For:\\n\\n- Prototypes where speed isn\'t critical\\n\\n## The DX Is Still Smooth\\n\\nWe know what you\'re thinking: \\"High performance usually means horrible developer experience.\\"\\n\\nNot here. The adapter integrates seamlessly with InversifyJS\'s decorator-based API:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { UwebSocketsMiddleware } from \'@inversifyjs/http-uwebsockets\';\\nimport { HttpRequest, HttpResponse } from \'uWebSockets.js\';\\n\\nexport class CustomHeaderMiddleware implements UwebSocketsMiddleware {\\n  public async handle(\\n    req: HttpRequest,\\n    res: HttpResponse,\\n    next: () => void\\n  ): Promise<void> {\\n    res.writeHeader(\'X-Powered-By\', \'InversifyJS + uWebSockets.js\');\\n    next();\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSame patterns, same decorators, same dependency injection. Just faster.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @inversifyjs/http-uwebsockets\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s it. Check out the [docs](https://inversify.io/docs/introduction/getting-started) for the full guide.\\n\\n## Real Talk\\n\\nIs uWebSockets.js the right choice for every project? No. \\n\\nIs Express still perfectly fine for most APIs? Absolutely.\\n\\nBut when you need to handle serious traffic, when every millisecond matters, when you\'re tired of scaling horizontally because your framework can\'t keep up - this adapter is here for you.\\n\\nBuilt with the same InversifyJS patterns you know. Just faster.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Try it out and let us know what you build.** We\'re especially curious about the throughput improvements you see in production.
